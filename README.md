# spring-security

This directory contains examples of implementation for the spring security module in different ways (Basic Auth, JWT Auth, LDAP, OAuth, SSO, ...)

This directory is born as a technical playground to learn Spring Security.

The projects on this repository is used as a support to the articles on my personal blog https://www.laghraoui.com/ (written in moroccan darija)
